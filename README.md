# spe-skill-test
this repo is for spe skill test purposes


Hi, greetings
My name is Dhiatamayo Fadhlika, here I want to explain some things.

First, I have finished the skill test with all the functions in spe-skill-test.py
Second, I work this test using Python, because it is the language that I'm proficient on. I don't know if this test can be accepted but I hope it can. I figured I just tried to finish the test and hope that it will be chekced. I use Python as my programming language in work, so it's quite efficient and handy for me. 

Thanks for the consideration.
